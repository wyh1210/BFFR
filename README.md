# Introduction
This is the implementation of the paper [Breaking Free from Fusion Rule: A Fully Semantic-driven Infrared and Visible Image Fusion
](https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.12286).
The main contribution is that we prove the feasibility of discarding hand-crafted fusion rules and only let the semantic segmentation task determine the fusion effect.

Here is a comparison with two typical semantic-driven fusion methods, the results show that ours outperform other semantic-driven methods by discarding fusion rules, and liberate the functionality of the semantic task.

We remove some semantic classes during the training process, results show that the semantic information is enough to determine how to fuse.

# Requirements
Install mmsegmentation package as following:
```
pip install mmcv-full==1.5.0 -f https://download.openmmlab.com/mmcv/dist/cu113/torch1.10/index.html
cd mmseg_bffr
pip install -e .
```
The `cuda` and `torch` version can be arbitrary, but you have to install `mmcv-full<=1.5.0` to meet the requirements of the `./mmseg` module in this repository.

# Datasets
You can download the [MFNet dataset](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/18BQFWRfhXzSuMloUmtiBRFrr6NSrf8Fw), and put it in ./data/ . You need to split the source images of 4 channels into RGB images of 3 channels and thermal images of 1 channel, in `png` format. Use `tools/seprate.py` for splitting.

# Test with the given model
Download the given model [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1BhkaEmb9AipI2Ib7pjSw1zwWoSy86X00/view?usp=share_link). Put it in ./weights/.
This project doesn't support distributed training. You'd better specify an idle GPU card like this: `export CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES=X`, `X` denotes the sequence number of the idle card.

- Test fusion effect
```
python tools/test_fusion.py configs/fuser_segmenters/transfuser_segformer_mit-b0_preavgfuser6.py weights/bffr.pth --gpu-id 0
```
* Calculate per-class IoU
```
python tools/test_fuser_segmenter.py configs/fuser_segmenters/transfuser_segformer_mit-b0_preavgfuser6.py weights/bffr.pth --gpu-id 0 --eval mIoU
```
+ Save the segmentation results in color
```
python tools/test_fuser_segmenter.py configs/fuser_segmenters/transfuser_segformer_mit-b0_preavgfuser6.py weights/bffr.pth --gpu-id 0 --show-dir ./seg_result
```

# Train from scratch
Download the pretrained backbone [mit_b0.pth](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1zhcQCl7-lIQh0sTGorhDJDo5kv9fBlGs/view?usp=sharing), put it in `./pretrain/`.
## Step 1: Pretrain the image fusion network (warm-start phase).
    python tools/train_fuser.py configs/fuser/transfuser6_avg.py --gpu-id 0
Put the obtained `work_dirs/transfuser6_avg/iter_20000.pth` into `./pretrain/`  and rename it as `avg_fuser.pth`.
In fact, you can name it whatever you like. It's ok as long as you confirm that the 10th line in `./configs/fuser/transfuser_segformer_mit-b0_preavgfuser6.py`, the `checkpoint='pretrain/XXX.pth` can locate to the path of the weight dict.

By the way, `avg_fuser.pth` can generate average fusion results. If interested, You can also test it by running: `python tools/test_fusion.py configs/fuser/transfuser6_avg.py pretrain/avg_20000.pth --gpu-id 0`. Average fusion is not the goal, but it can provide a good initialization for the next step.

## Step 2: Jointly train the fusion network and the segformer_b0 (semantic training phase).
    python tools/train_fuser_segmenter.py configs/fuser_segmenters/transfuser_segformer_mit-b0_preavgfuser6.py --gpu-id 0
You will get some weight dict in `./work_dirs/transfuser_segformer_mit-b0_preavgfuser6/`, you can test them in the way mentioned above.
